# My First Ever Game Made by Me, Using Pygame
This was my first time creating my own game without following any guide, course, or tutorial. All assets I used are from itch.io and are free to use.
I ran into a bunch of problems, such as sound files breaking collision detection or preventing the game from closing properly, which is why I commented some of them out.
Overall, it was fun, and I will definitely continue using Pygame.

When you start the game you control your character using wasd and the goal is to dodge the red balls as long as possible. 
The score keeps going up until you get hit and it will save your highest score in a highscore.txt file.
If you walk into the wall you appear on the oppsite side of the map.
Whenever you get hit, the game freezes and a Game Over! text appears, after this the game is over and you have to close the game and restart it to play again.
