# My First Ever Game Made by Me, Using Pygame
This was my first time creating my own game without following any guide, course, or tutorial. All assets I used are from itch.io and are free to use.
I ran into a bunch of problems, such as sound files breaking collision detection or preventing the game from closing properly, which is why I commented some of them out.
Overall, it was fun, and I will definitely continue using Pygame.
